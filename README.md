# Semantic Projection using GloVe
Python implementation of semantic projection from [Grand et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01316-8)

Download pre-trained GloVe vectors here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Notebook includes functions to calculate:
- Feature vector from two opposing word sets (such as {small, little, tiny} and {large, big, huge})
- Word projections onto feature vector
- Scalar "projection score" of words on feature vector
- Ranking of words on feature vector

There's also an example of running a regression of the semantic projection scores on a set of human ratings (generated by me):
